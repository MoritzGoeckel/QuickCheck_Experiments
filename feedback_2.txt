1.1 Structure

    Should come at the end of the introduction.
    The introduction tells the reader what to expect.
    Before diving into details, we tell the reader where specific topics are discussed.

Section 2 gives an introduction to QuickCheck in Haskell.
Section 3 considers QuickCheck in the Java setting and we draw
same comparisons about the look and feel of QuickCheck in both languages.

1.3 Automated software testing

One way to evaluate the correctness of software is to keep and eye on
irregularities while manually testing it. This way is very time consuming as
every test case has to be conducted by a person.

  Not clear what are you trying to say here. Which parts of testing are time consuming? More details.
  BTW. "an eye"

In automated software testing the three previously described phases
 
  The *three* phases need to be highlighted. Maybe, use enumeration.

1.4 The problem of testing large system

   Best to skip this part. QuickCheck doesn't solve all the testing problems.
   It's just a systematic method to create test cases.
